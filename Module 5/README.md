This project is an assignment for my Python class. In this assignment I will work on some problems and try to solve them with the help of data analysis. Here is the scenario given to me:

## Scenario

You are a data analyst for a brand-new New York City energy efficiency program. Your role at this early stage of the project is to gather, explore, and describe the data coming from NYC data providers. You should make a Jupyter notebook that is aimed at an intelligent layperson -- someone who isn't a data analyst like you. They should understand what you're doing and why it matters, even if they don't totally understand the code itself.

## Assignment
Create a notebook that:

* Includes the [data](https://github.com/CorkCork/Analytics-Programming/blob/master/Module%205/Data/Natural_Gas_Consumption_by_ZIP_Code_-_2010.csv) brought into my local environment. 
* Includes series and dataframe operations to determine:
   - The size of the data
   - The column labels. Are there problematic or surprising column labels? What would you suggest for column labels to use instead? Rename the DataFrame with new labels that will be easier to use. 
   - How many distinct building types are included, and their median energy consumption (in GJ). Are there building types that should be combined? 
   - What building type has the highest median GJ consumption? The lowest? Are you surprised?
   - How many utility data reporters are included, and the mean and standard deviation of their energy consumption.
* Suggestions for data improvement. You may have noticed a few things that could have been done better in the data collection. Mention them! ðŸŽ¯
