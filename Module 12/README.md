In this project, I will be doing the following:

* Ingest some data from [NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions-Crashes Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95) into a pandas data frame.
* Do any data cleaning or combining needed to make my data more useful and accurate.
* Select some data on which I am going to perform few statistical tests (two-sample t-test, chi-square test, and ANOVA) and explain why I'm choosing that particular data and why the test I'm choosing makes sense. 
* Interpret the result of my tests.
* Explain my statistical and data reasoning throughout my script using Markdown.
