## Module 10

In this project, I will be doing the following:

* Ingest some rows from the [NYPD Motor Vehicle Collision Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95) into a pandas DataFrame. I will use Socrata API to just select a limited number of rows.
* Choose a variable in my data and use that variable to conduct some aggregation and visualization.
* Explain my findings and use markdown to show my thinking as I go along.
