In this project, I am going to do some simple machine learning: I will be doing the following:

* Ingest some data from [NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions-Crashes Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95) into a pandas data frame.
* Split my data into training data (what I use to train my model) and testing data (what I use to see if my model is any good). 
* Use scikit learn to do some simple machine learning on my data. I will do a simple Decision Tree -- choose an outcome like "0", "1" or "2" injuries and use a tree algorithm to make predictions.
* Evaluate my model and describe its accuracy.
* Use Markdown to describe my decisions and code.
