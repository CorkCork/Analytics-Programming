## Module 8

In this project, I will be doing the following:

* Use pandas to ingest some data from [NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions-Crashes Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)
* Create a variable that consists of bins (e.g. "spring", "summer", "fall", "winter" based on datetime).
* Remove columns with too much missing data.
* Change the data type of one or more columns.
* Do a missingness analysis to understand missing data more fully.
* Add a new column and rename some of my columns.
* Use regex to identify values that contain certain substrings.
* Harmonize values (e.g. if "borough" appears in both UPPERCASE, lowercase, and Title Case, transform the variable to have the same format).
* Replace missing data indicators.
* Describe everything using a literate statistical programming paradigm.
* Create a README to help naive stakeholders understand what I've done and why.
