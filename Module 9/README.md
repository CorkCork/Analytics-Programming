## Module 9

In this project, I will be doing the following:

* Use pandas to ingest the [Community Health Survey dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Community-Health-Survey/2r9r-m6j4) from NYC Open Data.
* Use pandas methods (.info, .describe, .dtypes, etc.) to understand data more fully.
* Use pandas column selection to make DataFrame with just "Year", "Question" and "Prevalence" columns.
* Use pivot, twice:
  - First, make the question text the column header, and the year the row index
  - Next, make the year the column header, and the question text the row index
* Use Markdown to explain data, code, and next analytic steps.
