In this project I will be doing the following:

* Ingest a portion of [NYPD Motor Vehicle Collision Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95) into a pandas data frame.
* Using plotly, make two data visualizations, at least one of which is interactive. "Interactive" means, in our case, that the viewer can change the data visualization by zooming in, or clicking on a data point. 
* Use well-structured, grammatically correct, and useful guidance for the consumer of the code, using markdown.
