# Module 3

This project is an assignment for my Python class. For the assignment I was asked to do the following:

* Create a README file
* Create a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/CorkCork/Analytics-Programming/blob/master/Module%203/Module3assignment.ipynb)
 
 In the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/CorkCork/Analytics-Programming/blob/master/Module%203/Module3assignment.ipynb), I'm going to do the following:

* Reproduce all the things that I did in the [last module](https://github.com/CorkCork/Analytics-Programming/blob/master/Module%202/Module2assignment.ipynb)
* Using a loop, show the unicode value for each letter, using ord().
* For each lowercase letter of the alphabet, come up with a unique integer that is some calculated combination of the unicode value and/or the ordinal position of the letter in the alphabet.
* Make sure the code for each letter is unique, so that no code number repeats for more than one letter.
* Create a dictionary that gives, for each letter of the alphabet, the code value I created.
* Create an encoding function that takes a string of lower case letters and returns a list of integers representing the code number given to each letter.
* Make sure the function will exit with a helpful message if there is an element in the string that isn’t encodable (isn’t a lowercase letter).
* Try out the function using the word "hello".
* Try out the function using the string with uppercase letters "HELLO THERE!"
