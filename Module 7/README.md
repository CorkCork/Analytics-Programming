## Module 7

In this project, I will be doing the following:

* Use pandas to ingest and select some data from [NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions-Crashes Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)
* Then use at least one matplotlib plot,
* at least one pandas plot, and
* state what I discover in these visualizations. 
* Use a literate statistical programming approach -- use some combination of
* inline Markdown and
* a README to help naive stakeholders understand what I've done and why.
