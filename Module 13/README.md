In this project, I will be doing the following:

* Import NLTK's movie_reviews corpus (corpus = group of texts that together comprise a language example).
* Print the readme that accompanies the corpus.
* Print the number of reviews in the corpus.
* Print the categories found in the corpus.
* Print a selection of file ids from the corpus. 
* Print the raw text from one positive and one negative review.
* Use Markdown to explain what I am doing for a naive stakeholder.
