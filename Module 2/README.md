# Module 2

This project is an assignment for my Python class. For the assignment I was asked to do the following:

* Create a README file
* Create a Jupyter Notebook

In the Jupyter Notebook, I'm going to do the following:

* Create a list of all lower case letters
* Create a list of the numbers 1 to 26
* Use a for loop to print out which numbers in my list are divisible by 4
* Print both lists and show their types
* Using zip, create a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of the lower case letter and its numerical equivalent, 1-26
* Print the list of tuples, the type of the list, and the type of the first element in that list
* Using list comprehension, create a list of letters for which have ordinal values (1-26) that are multiples of 4
