In this project, I am going to do a logistic regression model, using a dichotomous categorical value for the outcome.

* Ingest some data from [NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions-Crashes Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95) into a pandas data frame.
* Select (and create) an "outcome" or "dependent" variable that has a dichotomous categorical value ("Yes", "No" / "Pass" , "Fail, etc.)
* Create a logistic model using scikit learn with one or two "independent" or "explanatory" variables. 
* With my model, try predicting the outcome variable using the same data I used to fit the model.
* Describe the accuracy of my model.
